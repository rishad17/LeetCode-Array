# ðŸ§© LeetCode Problem Solving â€“ Rishad Rahman

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, written in Python. I use this space to practice, experiment, and improve my algorithmic thinking through regular problem-solving.

## ðŸ“š About

- Solving problems to strengthen skills in data structures and algorithms
- Solutions are named after the official LeetCode problem titles for easy reference
- This is a personal learning project â€” not always optimized, but always improving

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Browse the repository and look for the problem name you're interested in
2. Open the file to view the code and (sometimes) the thought process
3. Use the solutions as a reference, study aid, or starting point for your own
4. Practice the same problems and compare approaches to find what works best for you

## ðŸ›  Language

- Python 3

## ðŸ’¡ Focus Areas

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Hashing, Sorting, Searching  
- Stack, Queue, and Heap usage  
- Pattern-based problem solving (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, etc.)

## ðŸ“… Goal

Stay consistent with practice and keep learning â€” one problem at a time.
